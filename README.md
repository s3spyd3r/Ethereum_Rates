## Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites

-   A web server with PHP 7.4 or higher (e.g., [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html), [WAMP](http://www.wampserver.com/en/), [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/)).
-   [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) installed.
-   The `curl` and `intl` PHP extensions must be enabled in your `php.ini` file.

### Installation

1.  Clone this repository or download and extract the source code to your web server's document root.
2.  Navigate to the `api/v1` directory in your terminal:
    ```bash
    cd api/v1
    ```
3.  Install the PHP dependencies using Composer:
    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

### Configuration
